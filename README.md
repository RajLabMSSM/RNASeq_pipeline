# SGSeq

Finds and classifies both annotated and novel splicing events

Incorporation of SGSeq in to the pipeline is still underway.


Requirements:

* BAM files aligned with a splice-aware aligner with the XS flag switched on

* A support file with these columns:
	``` sample_name bam_file conditionX ```

* * multiple conditions and covariates (must have the name type*) are allowed

* A submission file (see examples)


Currently set up for running on individual loci using the `region` string in config.yaml
